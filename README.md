# 🏠 MERN House Rental App (RentBridge)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **MERN House Rental App** (RentBridge) is designed to bridge the gap between property owners and renters.  
Our platform ensures that only **authentic, verified owners** can list properties, as all users must be approved by admins before they can access full functionality.  
This verification process reduces the risk of **cyber scams** and promotes a **secure, efficient, and optimized** owner–renter relationship.

## 🚀 Features
- **Secure User Authentication** – Registration, login, and role-based access control (Renter, Owner, Admin).
- **Property Listings** – Owners can add, edit, and delete their properties.
- **Property Search & Filters** – Renters can search properties by location, price, and amenities.
- **Property Booking** – Renters can book properties and view booking confirmations.
- **Wishlist** – Renters can save properties for later.
- **Admin Approval System** – Admins can approve or reject property listings.
- **Responsive UI** – Mobile-first, works across devices.
- **JWT Authentication** – Secure API endpoints with token-based access.
